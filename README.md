# SD-Trainer-Plugin

Openplanet plugin for Trackmania that swaps skidmark textures in real time based on speed drift quality.

## Download

- Get the latest build from the Releases page: <https://github.com/TNTisdial/sd-trainer-plugin/releases/latest>

## Status and compatibility

- This plugin is still a work in progress and needs more tuning/cleanup before Openplanet submission for School use.
- You must set Openplanet Signature Mode to `Developer` for this plugin to run.
- This plugin conflicts with `XertroV/tm-modless-skids` because both touch skid files in `ModWork`.
- If you leave Developer mode and want your previous skids back, open Modless-Skids settings in Openplanet, from the Trackmania main menu, click Open Modwork Folder, then delete `ModWork` entirely (not just the contents). Your previous skids/preferences should restore after loading a map.

## Install

- Copy `SD-Trainer-Plugin.op` to `C:\Users\<username>\OpenplanetNext\Plugins`.
- Launch Trackmania with Openplanet, change Signature Mode to `Developer`
- In Openplanet click the developer tab, hover over `Load Plugin` 
- Click SD-Trainer-Plugin

## What it does

- Computes drift quality (`driftQualityRatio`) each frame from measured acceleration vs surface-specific expected max acceleration.
- Maps quality to tiers: `default`, `poor`, `mid`, `high`.
- Swaps skid textures across asphalt, dirt, and grass.
- Includes a skin-picker UI for selecting tier textures per surface.

## Documentation

- `docs/io-system.md` for staging and swap pipeline details.
- `docs/acceleration-logic.md` for drift-quality computation.
- `docs/settings-reference.md` for runtime settings and defaults.
- `docs/skid-picker-ui.md` for UI behavior and hidden persisted fields.

## Credit

This project was passionately written using Zed editor and OpenCode.
AI Models such as GPT-5.3 Codex and Opus 4.6 had a hand in project-wide changes, like code structure/organization, documentation updates, and implementation ideas. 
Every line generated by AI, via tab completion and agentic loops have been thoroughly evaluated, to comply with Openplanet's AI generation policy. 

This project was not vibe coded, but AI helped.

Thanks to the people and projects that made this possible:

- XertroV (`XertroV/tm-modless-skids`) for core modless skid swap reference patterns.
- voblivion (`voblivion/Openplanet-IMG`) for DDS preview helper code used in `DDS_IMG/`.
- Magpie (`SilasDo/Trackmania-Speed-Drift-Trainer-Plugin`) for speed-drift acceleration logic direction.
- Runes for testing
- Shorty for proving the concept.
