## Download

- Get the latest build from the Releases page: <https://github.com/TNTisdial/sd-trainer-plugin/releases/latest>

## Install

- Copy `SD Trainer.op` to `C:\Users\<username>\OpenplanetNext\Plugins`.
- Launch Trackmania with Openplanet, change Signature Mode to `Developer`
- In Openplanet click the developer tab, hover over `Load Plugin` 
- Click SD-Trainer-Plugin


## What it does

- Computes drift quality (`driftQualityRatio`) each frame from measured acceleration vs surface-specific expected max acceleration.
- Maps quality to tiers: `default`, `poor`, `mid`, `high`.
- Swaps skid textures across asphalt, dirt, and grass.
- Includes a skin-picker UI for selecting tier textures per surface.

## Documentation

- `docs/io-system.md` for staging and swap pipeline details.
- `docs/acceleration-logic.md` for drift-quality computation.
- `docs/settings-reference.md` for runtime settings and defaults.
- `docs/skid-picker-ui.md` for UI behavior and hidden persisted fields.
- `docs/code-architecture.md` for module ownership and execution flow.

## Build package

- Run `python3 build_op.py` from repo root.
- The script creates an auto-slotted build artifact and also updates `SD Trainer.op` to the newest build.
- For releases and local install, use `SD Trainer.op`.

## Credit

Thanks to the people and projects that made this possible:

- XertroV (`XertroV/tm-modless-skids`) for core modless skid swap reference patterns.
- voblivion (`voblivion/Openplanet-IMG`) for DDS preview helper code used in `DDS_IMG/`.
- Magpie (`SilasDo/Trackmania-Speed-Drift-Trainer-Plugin`) for speed-drift acceleration logic direction.
- Runes for testing
- Shorty for proving the concept.

This project was passionately written using Zed editor and OpenCode.

AI Models such as GPT-5.3 Codex and Opus 4.6 had a hand in project-wide changes, like refactoring, architectural changes, documentation updates, packaging and implementation ideas. 

Every line generated by AI, via tab completion and agentic loops have been thoroughly evaluated, to comply with Openplanet's AI generation policy. 

This project was not vibe coded, but AI helped.
